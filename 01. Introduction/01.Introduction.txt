0. General:
- Cocoa is OOP
- Design: MVC
- iOS is object oriented
- Requires a lot of code writing
- OpenGL: Open Graphics Library is a cross-language, cross-platform application API for rendering 2D/3D vector graphics

1. iOS structure:

  <User>
  Cocoa Touch
  Media
  [Core Services] - Object-oriented layer
  [Core OS]       - Low-level services
  <Hardware>

1.1. Core OS: Mostly in C
- It's Unix
- OSX Kernel
- Mach 3.0: Kernel
- BSD
- Sockets: Unix domain socket, an end-point in local inter-process communication
- Security
- Power Management
- Keychain access
- Certificates
- File System
- Bonjour: Zero-configuration networking, enables automatic discovery of devices and services on a local network

1.2. Core Services:
- Collections
- Address Book
- Networking
- File Access
- SQLite
- Core Location
- Net Services
- Threading
- Preferences
- URL Utilities

1.3. Media:
- Core Audio
- OpenAL: OpenAL is a cross-platform audio application programming interface
- Audio Mixing
- Audio Recording
- Video Playback
- JPEG, PNG, TIFF (Tagged Image File Format)
- PDF
- Quartz (2D): Quartz 2D is the native two-dimensional graphics rendering API for macOS and iOS platforms
- Core Animation
- Core Graphics
- OpenGL ES: OpenGL for Embedded System

1.4. Cocoa Touch
- Prononciation [koko tatS]
- [Definition]: UI framework for building software programs for iOS
- It's an abstraction layer
- It's an UI layer: buttons, sliders and etc
- [Cocoa]: Apple's native object-oriented API for their operating system macOS

- Based on macOS Cocoa API

- MVC [model-view-controller] architecture
- Contains different [graphical control elements] than Cocoa

Elements:
- Multi-Touch
- Core Motion
- View Hierarchy
- Localization
- Controls
- Alerts
- Web Views
- Map Kit
- Image Picker
- Camera

2.Platform components:
- IDE:              Xcode 9
- Language:         Swift 4
- Frameworks:       UIKit, Foundations, MapKit, CoreData...
- Design strategy:  MVC

3. UIViewController:
- Usually, in an app, a new class is created and it inherits the needed propertires from UIViewController
